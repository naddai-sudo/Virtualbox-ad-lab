Mistakes, Missteps & Fixes — VirtualBox AD Lab Journey
1. Skipped ISO Selection on DC01

Issue:
When creating the Windows Server 2022 VM, I didn’t attach the ISO at first, so the VM booted to a command line with “No operating system found.”

Fix:
Recreated the VM and attached the Windows Server 2022 ISO under
Settings → Storage → Controller: IDE → Choose a disk file.

Lesson:
Always attach the ISO before first boot so the installer runs correctly.

2. Didn’t See “Network Adapter 1 and 2” Settings

Issue:
At first, I couldn’t find where to configure adapters.

Fix:
Learned they are located under
Settings → Network in each VM.
Adapter 1 = Host-only (for local lab network),
Adapter 2 = NAT (for internet).

Lesson:
VirtualBox hides adapter settings per machine — configure them before installing OS to save time.

3. Windows Server Setup Stuck / Finish Button Disabled

Issue:
“Finish” button was greyed out during setup.

Fix:
Adjusted Base Memory (RAM) and CPUs in the System → Motherboard / Processor section.
VirtualBox wouldn’t continue with too little memory (had 1 GB initially; bumped to 4 GB).

Lesson:
Resource allocation directly affects installation success — 4 GB+ RAM is ideal for Server 2022.

4. Missed Installing Guest Additions

Issue:
I wasn’t sure if “Guest Additions” needed to be selected before pressing Finish.

Fix:
Learned it should be installed after OS boots, from the VirtualBox top menu:
Devices → Insert Guest Additions CD Image → Run the installer inside the guest OS.

Lesson:
Guest Additions improves resolution, clipboard sharing, and network performance.

5. Network Adapter Didn’t Connect

Issue:
CLIENT01 couldn’t connect to DC01 over the Host-only network.

Fix:
Manually set static IPs:

DC01 → 192.168.56.10

CLIENT01 → 192.168.56.20

Both on subnet 255.255.255.0
and ensured Host-only Adapter was enabled on both.

Lesson:
Always confirm adapter type and static IPs match before testing domain joins.

6. Confusion During AD DS Setup

Issue:
Didn’t see the “Promote this server to a domain controller” link after adding the AD DS role.

Fix:
Used PowerShell command:

Install-ADDSForest


to manually trigger the domain setup wizard.
Domain successfully created as myhomelab.local.

Lesson:
Server Manager sometimes doesn’t show post-install prompts — PowerShell is a reliable fallback.

7. Logged in as vboxuser Instead of Administrator

Issue:
After reboot, system logged into a local VirtualBox user, not the AD Administrator.

Fix:
Logged out and selected Other user → entered
Administrator and my set password.

Lesson:
Post-domain promotion, you must log in with domain credentials, not the setup user.

8. CLIENT01 Couldn’t Join the Domain

Issue:
When attempting to join myhomelab.local, connection failed.

Fix:
Found out I was using Windows 10/11 Home Edition, which cannot join domains.

Lesson:
Only Pro, Education, or Enterprise editions of Windows can join an Active Directory domain.

9. Overlooked DHCP on Host-Only Network

Issue:
Originally thought DHCP should be left on.

Fix:
Disabled it and used static addressing (192.168.56.x range) for better control and predictability.

Lesson:
In isolated labs, static IPs make DNS and domain communication consistent.

10. Didn’t Understand Where to Set Static IP Initially

Issue:
Unsure where “set static IP” was in Server 2022 interface.

Fix:
Learned to open
Control Panel → Network and Internet → Network and Sharing Center → Change adapter settings → Ethernet → Properties → IPv4.

Lesson:
Even in Server Core-like UIs, networking is configured via Control Panel’s adapter properties.
